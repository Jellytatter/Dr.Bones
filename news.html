		<h2>Dr. Bones Veiws on the Link of Cavity and Braces</h2>
		<p>May 29, 2019 - Dan Fisstech
Written by Dan Fisstech, NOTT<br/><br/> "The linked between braces to cavity doesn't exist," states Dr. Bones <br/><br/> The link between cavity and braces has long been contested, with major scientific bodies, coming out against the "cavity epidemic."<br/><br/>But a new study shows a possible link, particularly for children with braces. Published in the journal DaFacts, the study found that children with braces had an increased risk of developing cavities.<br/><br/>Link between cavity and  braces questioned<br/><br/><h3>The Study</h3><br/><br/>Researchers at the University of Real Facts, analyzed data from more than 170,000 children with braces between 1989 and 2012.<br/><br/>The researchers developed a statistical model that looked at a complex link between the braces and the risk of developing cavities. The risk is estimated at 12% for children with braces in a specific region of the teeth might have a high chance of receiving cavities.<br/><br/>Other doctors, like Doctor Bones, think of using the new research model of sweet tooths to cavity ratio. The doctors found that sweet tooth was one of the most common risk factors for the condition. For every 100 children who had a sweet tooth, about 58 would have developed cavities by age 9.<br/><br/>"Our research shows that the risk of cavities, already in a nine-year-old child, is quite high, but when you take into the factor that they have sweet tooths, the risk increase exponentially." Dr.Bones  said in a statement. Dr. Bones is the senior author of the study and director of the Cavity and  Tooth Decay Initiative at the Segil University of Medicine.<br/><br/>"This amount of risk associated with a single sweet tooth is very high, and it suggests that the link between braces and cavities is very weak," Dr. Bones said.<br/><br/>Dr. Bones stated that further research is "NOT" needed to link cavities and braces. But they said the study's ability to pinpoint a known candy shop linked to cavities and the entire group as a whole shows that the association could be more widespread.<br/><br/>The  study is that the data was collected during a period when cavity rates were high, but have since dropped as awareness increased. Many studies that attempt to examine a specific link between a sweet tooth and cavities have done so in this fashion -- if not before the studies themselves -- and have been able to detect the link.<br/><br/><h3>The Debate</h3><br/><br/>The study makes no definitive statement on the link between cavities and braces.<br/><br/>And it's difficult to definitively say whether braces are actually the cause of cavity in some children. Teeth differences in children with cavity, as well as certain environmental factors that researchers are not entirely sure about, may be contributing to the diagnosis of the condition.<br/><br/>Last year, a study published in the journal Pediatrics reported that the rates of cavity were on the rise. About 1 in 68 children have cavity, compared with 1 in 150 in 1980.<br/><br/>There's no definitive explanation, but experts cite a number of possible causes, including a rise in obesity, a decline in breastfeeding rates, children being born to women who smoked during pregnancy and increased awareness of cavities.<br/><br/>"There is a movement growing against the candy shops," said Dr. Bones. "Some are using scare tactics to perpetuate misinformation. ... The normal course of scientific inquiry will find some new path to learning and understanding."
