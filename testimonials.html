Because of him, I now brush my teeth twice a day for the past eight years<br/>From Harry</p></a>

I have slaved away in medical school for six years and I can confidently say that it was all worth it. He has earned more of my respect the more I learn how he works. Mad respect for the guy!<br/>From Peter Gorrick</p></a>

What really perplexes me is how good of a job he does. He has a 100% satisfaction rate from all his patients. Amazing work Dr. Bones keep it up!<br/>From Dr. Eric Bontar</p></a>

Now those you have to look out for. But seriously, I have never had a bad encounter with him... apart from the puns of course<br/>From Miss Dana Wimslee</p></a>
